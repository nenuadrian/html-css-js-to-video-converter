This process of converting a website based presentation into a video can be extremely effective and useful for those who want to automate video generation or leverage their skills in web development instead of learning a new video editor, and sometimes being limited by it.

Additionally, this fits well with automation and programatically generating videos.

By following this guide, youâ€™ll be able to take any HTML, CSS and JavaScript based website you might have created, whether it uses other libraries for fancy animations or not, and record automatically visiting and interacting with the website.


```
npm install
npm run start:dev
```
